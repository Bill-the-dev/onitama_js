        <p>Onitama is a two-player chess variant where the player moves pawns across a 5x5 grid using a set of five movement cards.</p>
        
        <p>The player may use a card to move any of their pawns in the pattern depicted, however, this card is then exchanged with a card outside the board. This allows both players rotating access to all 5 movement cards in play!</p>
        
        <p>The game is easy to learn thanks to its unique visual design. It also allows for a high level of strategic gameplay with it's dynamic moveset.</p>
        
        <p>Onitama was designed by Shimpei Sato and published in print by Arcane Wonders. Learn more and support the original
